### Dataset Description
The Movie Database (TMDB) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. This data set contains information about over 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like `‘cast’` and `‘genres’`, contain multiple values separated by pipe `(|)` characters.
There are some odd characters in the `‘cast’` column.
The final two columns ending with `“_adj”` show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

### Question(s) for Analysis
- Which director made the most popular movie?

- What period of the year(release date) grossed the greatest revenue? Based on this information, the director can choose to release the movie at such a period in the year.

- Does a higher budget necessarily leads to higher revenue?

- That a movie is highly voted for on average necessarily means the movie is widely accepted(popularity)?

- What year had the highest number of movie releases?

- Which movie i.e.original title( alongide its genre, director) is highly rated.

- Do people appreciate longer-time movies or not?
